# Netflix clone

This project is done for educational purpose.

## Full clone of Netflix coming soon!

I am developing the full clone of Netflix which includes the front page and firebase authentications. As I finish, I will replace this field with its github link and web link.

### How to use in local machine

Clone or download into your machine.

### How to start

Open a terminal in the Netflix clone directory, and write npm install or yarn start to install all necessary packages of the Netflix clone.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### API KEY

Please find your own API_KEY from [imdb.com](https://imdb.com/), and use that key at requests.js to retrieve images of the movies and others.
